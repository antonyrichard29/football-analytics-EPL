football Analytics-EPL

This project applies machine learning to real-world football data from the English Premier League (EPL) 2020â€“21 season to uncover deep insights and simulate realistic match scenarios. It features player performance analysis, goal and assist statistics, penalty efficiency, and age distribution. Advanced ML models are used to predict match outcomes, estimate player transfer value, cluster teams based on performance, and simulate live match commentary. The project combines data visualization, classification, regression, and clustering techniques to deliver actionable football insights.

The dataset used for training and testing the movie football analytics model is included in this repository.
